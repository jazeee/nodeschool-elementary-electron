My solutions to Nodeschool elementary-electron. Some in coffee-script

NodeSchool is great for reviewing and filling in the gaps!

This one is obviously fairly elementary, but I am doing it to help with mentoring.

```
sudo npm install -g coffee-script
npm install
coffee -c --output compiled ./
```
Then run
```
node_modules/.bin/elementary-electron
```

Run against my solutions in this directory.
